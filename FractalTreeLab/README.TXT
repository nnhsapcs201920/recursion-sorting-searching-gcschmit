Fractal Tree Lab

# Introduction
# 
The goal of this lab is to create a recursive algorithm to draw a
	tree.

Imagine you were describing how to draw a tree. You might say:

1. Draw a vertical line

2. At the top of the line, draw two smaller lines ("branches") in a v
	shape

3. At the ends of each of those two branches, draw two even smaller
	branches

4. Keep repeating the process, drawing smaller and smaller branches
	until the branches are too small to draw

This process of repeating the same design at a continually decreasing
	scale is an example of a *Fractal*. Using fractals to draw trees
	can give some interesting and beautiful
	patterns[.](http://www.visualbots.com/tree_project.htm) In this
	assignment we will use a recursive branching function to create a
	fractal tree.

# Requirements
# 
* Use the Koch Snowflake program as a starting point for an
	TreeViewer class and a TreeComponent class.

* The Math class has a lot of helpful methods:

    * Math.sin(), Math.cos()

    * Math.toRadians()

* The trunk of the tree needs four values: the *X* and *Y* of the
	starting point and the *X* and *Y* of the end point. We will also
	have three member variables that will control:

    * how much smaller the branches are

    * how small the branches will get

    * the angle between the branches.

* You determine what methods are needed for the recursive method.

# Extensions
# 
* Add controls (e.g., sliders) to allow the user to change member
	variables that affect the construction of the tree.

* Some fantastic trees can be produced by modify algorithm to add
	asymmetry, adjust angles, adjust thickness, or adjust color.

* Add a creative effect for the terminating condition.

* Add more awesome.

# Submission
# 
* Submit a link to your GitHub repository with this assignment.

* If you would like your Fractal Tree Lab featured on the school TVs,
	take a screenshot of your image and add it to the [shared Google
	slide
